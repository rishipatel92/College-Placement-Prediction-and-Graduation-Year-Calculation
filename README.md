# College Placement Prediction and Graduation Year Calculation

# Introduction:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my College Placement Prediction project! ðŸŽ“ This project is a part of my internship with Cloud Counselage, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this insightful endeavor.

# Project Focus:
The primary goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a student securing placement during their college tenure. The prediction is based on three different models: XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. By leveraging these models, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing placement outcomes.

# Project Components:
 1. Prediction Models:
  XGBoost: Utilizing the power of gradient boosting, XGBoost delivers accurate predictions by combining weak learners.
  Decision Tree: A classic model for decision-making, the decision tree aids in understanding the decision pathways leading to placement predictions.
  Logistic Regression: This statistical method provides insights into the probability of placement based on various input features.
2. Internship with Cloud Counselage:
 This project is made possible through the internship with Cloud Counselage. Their support and collaboration have been instrumental in the development and success of this predictive model. 
 
 # Graduation Year Calculation:
 In addition to placement prediction, the project includes a feature to calculate the anticipated year of graduation based on the student's current academic standing. This feature adds a practical element, helping students plan for their future.
